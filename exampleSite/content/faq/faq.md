**-Do you travel?**

Yes! I am located in the Tampa bay area, and will go anywhere within a 40 mile radius for any shoot, for no additional cost. Outside of the 40 miles, I add on a mileage fee. I also travel out of state (some restrictions may apply currently), but there is a travel fee added on instead of the mileage fee. The travel fee varies slightly by location, but expect a minimum of $350. If I am booking more than one session in your area, that fee may be split between clients! So tell your friends! ;)

**-How soon do I get my photos?**

Portrait and branding photos will be sent to you within three weeks maximum. Weddings will be within one month of the wedding date! Usually it's only a week or two because I am so excited to get your photos to you, but busier times of year cause for more delays. However, I always send a sneak peek soon after your session!

**-I'm awkward and don't know how to pose.**

Don't stress about it! So many people feel this way. I will work with you and give you some prompts for posing, but I also don't stress too much about having a perfectly posed image. I prefer to interact with you and see your real self come out. With couples and families, it's the same thing. The best photos often come when people are just being themselves and interacting that way rather than forcing a smile. Don't worry, I'll make sure to capture some classic poses, and still customize the shoot to what you're looking for, but apart from that, it's going to be about you being yourself.

**-What if I don't know how much coverage I'll need for my wedding or session?**

All of my shoots come with a consultation, and this starts before even booking. This way I can learn about what you're wanting out of your session, get to know you a little, and make sure you're picking the package that works best for you!

**-How soon do I need to pay for my shoot?**

I require a nonrefundable retainer fee as soon as we confirm a session date and time. This guarantees your date for you and is 35% of the session cost. (This is a part of the session prices listed, not in addition to). Without this retainer, I cannot guarantee that session will still be available for that time slot later. The rest of the session cost is due in full by the day before the session, but I do offer payment plans if desired. Payment options include Venmo, Paypal, cash or paying with card via an invoice I send you.

**-What if I need to cancel my shoot?**

The retainer fee is nonrefundable if you choose to cancel. However, it does apply towards rescheduling, if you contact me about this at least a week before the schedule date. Not showing up for your shoot, or trying to reschedule last minute may result in the retainer being forfeited. I do make exceptions for things such as natural disasters and personal emergencies, and if the weather results in a shoot not working out, I will always reschedule!

**-Do you offer any other packages?**

I try to customize each shoot as much as possible for you and your goals. The packages listed are my main options, but I try to honor requests as much as possible. If you are looking for something you don't see, feel free to send me a message! I also know that budgets and circumstances can sometimes make it difficult to get quality pictures, so I do offer a limited number of mini packages each month designed for people on a budget. If this is something you are looking for, let's get in touch!

**-Can I buy prints of my photos?**

When you receive your gallery of images, there will be an option to purchase basic print sizes of an image! I work with a high quality image lab, and love the results I have gotten thru them. I have several packages options as well if you're looking for something quick and easy, and also offer some other print options such as canvases.
