Family portraits can seem like a headache, but I make my shoots built around your family and what makes you you.  If your kids love to run outside, if they love the beach, if your family has a special home with lots of memories, I can work with almost anything. My whole life has been spent around large families, so I have a lot of experience with kids, large groups of people, and making people feel comfortable in all sorts of situations.

Standard family sessions include up to 8 people and begin at $175, but I also work with larger groups.  Contact me for a customized quote, or see my info page.
