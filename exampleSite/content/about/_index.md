My name is Abigail (although all my friends call me Abbie!)  

<br>

I have been interested in photography since high school, and dabbled in it then.  My aunt was a photographer and helped fuel that interest and give me insights into it.  I bought my first "real" camera as soon as I graduated in 2012 and have shot part time ever since.  At first I shot mostly landscape and nautre photos, but the last 5 years that switched to portraits and other interest with it.

One of my favorite parts about photography is being able to capture emotions and little moments that are so special, that might even be missed if they weren't captured.  I love the little smiles and touches, the connection between people.  Toddlers and younger children are some of my favorite people to shoot because they are so genuine and real and just straight emotion with no filter.
