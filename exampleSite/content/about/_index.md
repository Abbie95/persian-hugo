My name is Abigail (although all my friends call me Abbie!)

I have been interested in photography since high school, and started dabbling in it then. My aunt was a photographer and gave me tips & really 	first inspired me to do more with it. I bought my first "real" camera as soon as I graduated in 2012 and have shot part time ever since.

One of my favorite parts about photography is being able to capture emotions and little moments that are so special but might even be missed or forgotten if they weren't captured. I love the little smiles and touches, the connection between people. Toddlers and younger children are some of my favorite people to shoot because they are so genuine & real and just straight emotion with no filter. Photos capture a moment in time that can bring back all the emotions and memories you felt at that moment.

I worked in the coffeeshop/patissiere industry for several years and that was where my interest in food and product photography began. I realized the difference having good photos for your brand or business can make when I began meeting other business owners and visiting new spots as I traveled. A lot of times the make or break decision in where I would eat or shop came down to the quality of the images on their social media and how their brand came across thru that. I have always worked for small businesses and understand the passion and commitment that go into them, and having quality images and a quality web presence can help portray that.

I have grown up in the midwest but have had the goal of living in Florida ever since my first visit. 2020 brought that around despite everything that happened in the world, and I am so excited to spend more years here.

My editing style varies slightly by shoot and style, as I love light and color, but also love some good moody tones. I want to be able to give you a photoshoot that is as special as you, wether that is through capturing a special day, shooting at a spot that is memorable to you, encapturing what makes your brand or business unique, capturing a special time in your life with family, or just photographing you as the special person you are. I love meeting people and hearing their stories, and can't wait to meet you!
